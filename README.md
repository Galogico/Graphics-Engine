# Graphics-Engine
This is a graphics engine made entirely in Rust using minifb(frame buffer), glam(math crate) and image for rendering. It apparently works on Windows, Linux, and Mac as far as I know.
To run it, download Rust, cargo, and hit "cargo run" in the program folder.
## Features
wasd -> control triangle
